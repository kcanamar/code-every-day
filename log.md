# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 8: August 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed on Leetcode challenge today.

**Thoughts**: This was a real thinker for sure, the inital problem took me some time to understand what it was asking me to do. Solved it so that was a win, but then I went after the bonus part of the challenge to make the space complexity O(1) that was much harder. 
I tired for a while and went to google for help to understand how to achieve this as I had no idea, I found that [IndecisionTree](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-from-permutation/discuss/1315926/Python-O(n)-Time-O(1)-Space-w-Full-Explanation) had a great solution in python explaining the process. I then looked up solutions on Euclidean Division JavaScript solutions to see how to apply what I had just learned. Leading me to a solution by [RinatRezyapov](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-from-permutation/discuss/2294854/JavaScript-Space-O(1)-Euclidean-division). 
I must say that learning about euclidean division was facinating and [Elliot Nicholson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KLyGdPy7ns) has a great video sieres explaining this concept.

## Day 7: August 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Time conversion problem on HackerRank

**Thoughts**: This was sitted as easy however I found this on a true challenge in respects of having to think through this in a very particular way to meet the test requirements. I had one solution I hought would work, but only passed half of the tests. So instead of banging my head against the wall to make it work I decided to start fresh and create a new solution and low and behold I passed all tests. Learning how to walk away from one approach when faced with issues and to pivot to a solution that fulfills the required tests.

## Day 6: August 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed on problem on HackerRank, Leetcode, and Codewars.

**Thoughts**: Juggling kids make for a limited amount of time to code, I am proud that I was able to complete 3 problems today, especially a few that really tested my comprehension as to what specifically they were asking. Still getting comfortable answering technical questions, and finding the correct syntax for certin JS Methods, thank you MDN for the amazing documentation.

## Day 5: August 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed free trial of edabit.com, completed first HackerRank challenge.

**Thoughts**: Edabit.com was awesome for beginners and I was looking forward to turning up the difficulty however my free trial ended. I was hoping to not hit a pay barrier oh well. After reaching that point I decided to move on to HackerRank and start using this platform. I am very impressed with the layout of the questions being asked on hackerrank and how they display their unit test. I end the day with renewed vigor to start learning about how to implement my own unit tests using mocha & chai.

## Day 4: August 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed my first leetcode problem. 

**Thoughts**: Leetcode is amazing, the detailed review of your code.
I am going to be honest this problem stupped me for a good while, I appreciate the complexity of the questions and I know this is an easy one.
I am eagar and excited to see what more challenges are ahead.

## Day 3: August 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Began re-reading through MDN Javascript String Methods, and Math Methods. 
Then decided to do a few codewars problems to flex my comprehension. 

**Thoughts**: I felt good overall, I did find myself to struggle with these 8kyu challenges. 
I do need to read much more vanilla Javascript to get these to sink even further into my brain.
Will he survive question took me longer then what I had hope for and was not the most elagent solution.
I can honestly say that I am appriciative for challenging myself to spend more time doing coding challenges.

### Day 2: August 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read lots of documentation on how to use styled-components with NextJS 12 paired with babel-plugin-styled-components. Implemented styled-components and built out a few components to test intergration.

**Thoughts**: I am starting to comprehend technical writings more and more everday, I struggle with reading comrephension. Better to work on it everyday than allow the weakness to persist without any efforts to imporve. Looking forward to getting some time into building this blog out more in the coming days.

### Day 1: August 19, 2022
 
**Today's Progress**: Began building my personal blog site using NextJS & MDX

**Thoughts**: I want to create a platform that will allow me to share the learning that I am about to undertake during this 100 day challenge.
