# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 17: September 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal

**Thoughts**: Well after my success yesterday I decided to jump in the deep end and try a medium level leetcode problem focused on algorithms. From my reading yesterday along with a lot of reading on Breath First Search Algorithms and Binary Tree Structures. I was able to come up with a solution, though my brain feels like it is exploding. Computer Science is a hard, I will admit it, but I will learn this and I will be a better programmer because of it.

## Day 16: September 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Sparse Arrays

**Thoughts**: I spent about 2 hours reading up on data structures in JS today and was grateful for that as today I was able to used what I learned to solve this problem. I am honestly not sure if this is the best way to go about creating a solution to this challenge.

## Day 15: September 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Divisible Sum Pairs

**Thoughts**: Starting to feel confident working through basic word problems. Spent most of the day reading more on javascript and how to think critically through word problems. I know that reading comprehension is on of my biggest areas of opportunity, so I am absorbing as much as I can.

## Day 14: September 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created base for dashboard

**Thoughts**: Worked through how to separate the main parts of the drawer component, giving me access to the different section of the component to further customize the content.

## Day 13: August 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Successful integration of Material UI and NextJS, started building out the site layout.

**Thoughts**: Wanted to learn how to best use Material UI with NextJS and practice building different site layouts. Looking forward to continuing to improve my UI/UX skills with MUI and NextJS.

## Day 12: August 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Camel Case 4 on HackerRank & Reverse Integer on Leetcode.

**Thoughts**: These were for sure some brain teasers, The camelCase tripped me up for a while due to the logic. The Reverse Integer game me issues due to the constraints. I know I challenged myself but I am building confidence in how to think programaticaly.

## Day 11: August 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Breaking the Records on HackerRank.

**Thoughts**: I am feeling good right now, I have some good time tomorrow planned out to really get a nice day of learning in. Little by little gotta keep coding.

## Day 10: August 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Count By X on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: Been a long weekend wedding planning just got home from being on the road all day and this was a big win for me. Staying on the grind is just as much commitment as sacrifice. Cheers to a big win today, meeting my commitments, tomorrow I look forward to some good time for coding.

## Day 9: August 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Counting Sheep on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: This was a rather simple problem to solve. Currently planning our wedding in Vegas this weekend so time is a little limited. Got a chance to read more EloquentJS. Work in progress looking forward to tomorrow for a tougher challenge.

## Day 8: August 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed on Leetcode challenge today.

**Thoughts**: This was a real thinker for sure, the initial problem took me some time to understand what it was asking me to do. Solved it so that was a win, but then I went after the bonus part of the challenge to make the space complexity O(1) that was much harder. 
I tired for a while and went to google for help to understand how to achieve this as I had no idea, I found that [IndecisionTree](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-from-permutation/discuss/1315926/Python-O(n)-Time-O(1)-Space-w-Full-Explanation) had a great solution in python explaining the process. I then looked up solutions on Euclidean Division JavaScript solutions to see how to apply what I had just learned. Leading me to a solution by [RinatRezyapov](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-from-permutation/discuss/2294854/JavaScript-Space-O(1)-Euclidean-division). 
I must say that learning about euclidean division was fascinating and [Elliot Nicholson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KLyGdPy7ns) has a great video sieres explaining this concept.

## Day 7: August 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Time conversion problem on HackerRank

**Thoughts**: This was cited as easy however I found this on a true challenge in respects of having to think through this in a very particular way to meet the test requirements. I had one solution I thought would work, but only passed half of the tests. So instead of banging my head against the wall to make it work I decided to start fresh and create a new solution and low and behold I passed all tests. Learning how to walk away from one approach when faced with issues and to pivot to a solution that fulfills the required tests.

## Day 6: August 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed on problem on HackerRank, Leetcode, and Codewars.

**Thoughts**: Juggling kids make for a limited amount of time to code, I am proud that I was able to complete 3 problems today, especially a few that really tested my comprehension as to what specifically they were asking. Still getting comfortable answering technical questions, and finding the correct syntax for certin JS Methods, thank you MDN for the amazing documentation.

## Day 5: August 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed free trial of edabit.com, completed first HackerRank challenge.

**Thoughts**: Edabit.com was awesome for beginners and I was looking forward to turning up the difficulty however my free trial ended. I was hoping to not hit a pay barrier oh well. After reaching that point I decided to move on to HackerRank and start using this platform. I am very impressed with the layout of the questions being asked on hackerrank and how they display their unit test. I end the day with renewed vigor to start learning about how to implement my own unit tests using mocha & chai.

## Day 4: August 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed my first leetcode problem. 

**Thoughts**: Leetcode is amazing, the detailed review of your code.
I am going to be honest this problem stumped me for a good while, I appreciate the complexity of the questions and I know this is an easy one.
I am eager and excited to see what more challenges are ahead.

## Day 3: August 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Began re-reading through MDN Javascript String Methods, and Math Methods. 
Then decided to do a few codewars problems to flex my comprehension. 

**Thoughts**: I felt good overall, I did find myself to struggle with these 8kyu challenges. 
I do need to read much more vanilla Javascript to get these to sink even further into my brain.
Will he survive question took me longer then what I had hope for and was not the most elagent solution.
I can honestly say that I am appreciative for challenging myself to spend more time doing coding challenges.

### Day 2: August 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read lots of documentation on how to use styled-components with NextJS 12 paired with babel-plugin-styled-components. Implemented styled-components and built out a few components to test integration.

**Thoughts**: I am starting to comprehend technical writings more and more everyday, I struggle with reading comprehension. Better to work on it everyday than allow the weakness to persist without any efforts to improve. Looking forward to getting some time into building this blog out more in the coming days.

### Day 1: August 19, 2022
 
**Today's Progress**: Began building my personal blog site using NextJS & MDX

**Thoughts**: I want to create a platform that will allow me to share the learning that I am about to undertake during this 100 day challenge.
