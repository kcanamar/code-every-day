# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 3: August 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Began re-reading through MDN Javascript String Methods, and Math Methods. 
Then decided to do a few codewars problems to flex my comprehension. 

**Thoughts**: I felt good overall, I did find myself to struggle with these 8kyu challenges. 
I do need to read much more vanilla Javascript to get these to sink even further into my brain.
Will he survive question took me longer then what I had hope for and was not the most elagent solution.
I can honestly say that I am appriciative for challenging myself to spend more time doing coding challenges.

### Day 2: August 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read lots of documentation on how to use styled-components with NextJS 12 paired with babel-plugin-styled-components. Implemented styled-components and built out a few components to test intergration.

**Thoughts**: I am starting to comprehend technical writings more and more everday, I struggle with reading comrephension. Better to work on it everyday than allow the weakness to persist without any efforts to imporve. Looking forward to getting some time into building this blog out more in the coming days.
