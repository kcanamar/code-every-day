# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 13: Feburary 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Built mobile responsive navbar

**Thoughts**: Worked off of a Kevin Powell video building a mobile responsive nav bar. After hours of reading on css properties and various logical properties, I am starting to get a better grasp on frontend CSS. I recognized that it was one of my weaknesses that I want to improve this quarter and building from scratch with vanilla helps me build a better foundation when I go to adapt and implement these tactics within React.

## Day 10: Feburary 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio Styling

**Thoughts**: Spent my day styling with CSS modules in Next.js. Met some unexpected work arounds that are presented by Next, one being the way you import and use google fonts, another being how you use font-awesome icons. I did met an error in my deployment that I will have to triage in tomorrow, but over all feel really good about what I was able to accomplish today.

## Day 9: Feburary 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio skeleton

**Thoughts**: Decided to get back to work on my portfolio and add in a blog feature for my future content. I am going to be building out my Portfolio over the next several weeks and will be adding features in one by one. Then I will look to style it more, I knwo I should be styling more but just haven't had the motivation yet.

## Day 8: Feburary 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Leetcode, FastAPI && Flask basics

**Thoughts**: Today learned how to start both a FastAPI and Flask server, just setup basic listening servers still need to hook up a SQL db to both and define the CRUD routes. Also practiced on leetcode a problem that challenged me to implement a look a like to the sliding window approach.

## Day 7: Feburary 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Jsonwebtoken Authentication with Express.js

**Thoughts**:  So today I revisited how to implement authentication using jsonwebtokens in an Express server. Battled through a few typos and a couple trips to the docs, in the end was able to grokk the fundementals to achieve the desired end result. After taking myself thorugh this process in a practice environment I decided to implement this into my portfolio-api to protect my POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. Feeling good about how I was able to implement this so far, next step is to understand how to work through authentication with multiple realtionships.

## Day 6: Feburary 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Django Basic Todo App

**Thoughts**: Today I decided to brush up on my Django and create a simple todo app. Nothing fancy here just making sure that all the gears are working properly and that I can still remember how to write python code.

## Day 5: Feburary 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Leetcode

**Thoughts**: Strapped up my boots today to dig into practicing some algorithms on leetcode. Was able to get some practice with two-pointers and merge interval, feeling confident with what I was able to complete and looking forward to getting auth setup on my portfolio api tomorrow.

## Day 4: January 31, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio Api

**Thoughts**: Continued working on my portfolio API, I am building this to constantly be updating my portfolio with new projects and content in a centuralized location. I refactored the codebase to reflect MVC design, spreading the route logic across two different locations, the routes and the controllers. This was a great way for me to be able to put into practice what I came to love about building API's. Looking forward to add authentication to this API so that way no one but myself will be able to interact with the data outside of GET requests.

## Day 3: January 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Problem

**Thoughts**: So today had a technical interview, so spent most of my day preping for it by reading documentation. However I did get to a leetcode problem that challenged me to implement the in-place algortihm. Having never done that before was a tall task but after words felt really good about what I learned and how I can build upon that algorithm.

## Day 2: January 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Began rebuilding Portfolio

**Thoughts**: Well the saying goes "use it or loose it." I did not loose it but I sure did struggle getting my frontend to play nice with my api. I leanred today that you cannot call getStaticProps from inside of a component rather it must be down on the page and passed to the component as props. If anyone has any experience that would contridicte my findings please feel free to share them as this was a big chunck of time. Feeling really good otherwise about how far I got on this project, excited to see how it turns out in the coming days.

## Day 1: January 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Codewars Challenges

**Thoughts**: After taking a mental health break from daily coding. I am proud to say that I am ready to once again tackle the #100daysofcode challenge. I have ben learning so much recently and really looking forward to sharing what I have been learning publicly. <br> Today I spent the vast majority freshing up on JavaScript Array methods and String methods on Codewars. Tomorrow looking to start building out the frontend of my new portfolio/blog site with Next.js.
