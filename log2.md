## Day 76: April 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Codewars

**Thoughts**: Traveling today to visit my grandfather over the weekend, Got some coding in while waiting for my flight. A few codewars problems and some design work on a side project. Tonight I may play around with jest more and see what sort of tests I can create.

## Day 75: April 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Jest

**Thoughts**: Today I wrote my first Unit Test in Jest. The boogieman has been confronted and I am so ready to start diving into my code and learning how to use this testing suit across alll of my JavaScript projects, both past and future. I find it to be a worth while undertaking to try and revisit my previous code bases and to try and implement a test suit on existing code, as well as being able to develop with a TDD approach. So much good stuff today, and 6 months till my wedding day!

## Day 74: April 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Node.js and Docker

**Thoughts**: One word, WOW! I am blown away with how I was able to learn how to create a CI/CD pipline using github actions and how to leverage that with a docker image. I am so insipred to learn how to create my own piplines and to build even more professional applications.

## Day 66: April 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Codewars

**Thoughts**: Short day, had a fun filled day of Pokemon hunting with my kids today, short time coding along with more learning on Data Sprawl and Data Drift. Truly fascinating when you start to learn how many copies of out data really exist, and how the use of a Data Lakehouse or cloud storage such as AWS, Azure and Google cloud are impacting the space of data stroage. Simiarly the Apache Arrow project creating many tools to inovate and improve data stroage on the open source level. So much learning, working on a blog post covering all of this learning.

## Day 65: April 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Codewars

**Thoughts**: Short day, taking time wil my son as it is his spring break. A few codewars problems and a lot of reading on OLTP, OLAP, Data Wharehouses, as well as Data Lakes. Been diving deep into how data is stored and used to leveraged by Data scientists/analytists, so much comprehension behind extract tranfer load (ETL & ELT). All I can say is that I am falling in love with data!

## Day 62: March 31, 2023

**Today's Progress**: React-Native/Expo

**Thoughts**: So far half way through the tutorial by JavaScript Mastry on React-Native, had a few challenges with loading the `env` variables. I was able to work around it by adjusting the `plugins` array in the `bable.config.js` after that I was able to inmport my variables and use them as intended. Over all still sick and hoping to get better soon, cheers to a bright new day tomorrow.

## Day 61: March 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: React-Native/Expo

**Thoughts**: I have been eyeing a course on react native from Javascript Mastery, so why not start today. Spent a lot of time reading through the code to understand what I will be doing with it as this course provides a lot of boiler plate. I was aslo able to continue working on my DSA course provided by Jovian in python. Blending languages is tricky but with the right mindset I find it as enjoyable as speaking english with my kids and spanish with my wife.

## Day 60: March 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Codewars

**Thoughts**: I hate being sick, and having sick kids. No excusses I am still commited to coding, I had a lofty day helping debugging with the students in my cohort. Was able to solve and algorithm before needing to sleep

## Day 59: March 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Codewars

**Thoughts**: Lots of moving pieces today with the family, had to balance sick kids and my current work. Able to complete some algorithm challenges on codewars, and start a DSA course in python today, more to come on that in the coming weeks.

## Day 58: March 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Yelp & React.js

**Thoughts**: So today had a crazy idea, I wanted to show my kids what you can do with coding and problem solving. I decided to code for them a basic react app connected to Yelp fusion API. This was a lot more than I had anticipated, I was not aware that yelp does not like frontend devs, all of the CORS issues today. But I was ble to get around it and to deploy a working prototype of fetching data from Queens,NY and also selecting a single restaurant from the selection. I feel really proud of what I was able to acomplish with extremely limited documentaion, and false hope from the devs at Yelp. If you want to view the live site you may have to turn on the proxy server by visiting this [site](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) first

## Day 55: March 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Vanilla JavaScript & SupaBase

**Thoughts**: Ran into a couple of roadblocks when trying to implement SupaBase with Expo, so decided to take two steps back to gain some foundational knowledge with Supabase. Followed an excellent tutorial provided by Supaship, covered the majority of the getting started section of Supabase. Now that I am armed with new knowledge I think I will revisit Expo in the coming days.

## Day 51: March 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Expo

**Thoughts**: Began Learning Expo this evening, had to wait for the kidos to go to bed so I can get some work in. Decided to pivot away from Ionic for my React-Native development, to many errors and not the best documentation in my opinion. So far so good with Expo, head and shoulders above Ionic, but again I am biased. Looking to wrap up there intro tutorial tomorrow.

## Day 48: March 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Ionic

**Thoughts**: Finished the tutorial, however not really sure how to view my deployed application on the web. All of the documentation I have been reading ahs been all over the place. I am going to keep reading on this this evening but if I can't find out how, I think it will be on to Expo to attempt a different native development approach.

**Links to Work** [repo](https://github.com/kcanamar/ionic-tutorial)
## Day 47: March 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Ionic

**Thoughts**: Today, was a doozy! I had no supporting software for native development when trying to test my ionic application, so most of my day was spent battling through erros. I did succeed and my application can be tested, and viewed on my iphone. Tomorrow I plan on completeing the tutorial.

**Links to Work** [repo](https://github.com/kcanamar/ionic-tutorial)
## Day 46: March 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Ionic

**Thoughts**: Today, I needed to take a break from writing code in go, I was runningn into some issues with my update route with mongo and instead of getting bent out of shape I decided to pivot and spend my time learning something new, Ionic (React). I have been wanting to branch out into mobile development and everything I have been reading has been pointing to either Expo or Ionic, so I made the leap and decided to go with Ionic. Only a few step into the tutorial so far and coming to terms with not only learning a new way to build an application using React, but also having to learn Typescript at the same time. Going to finish this demo tomorrow and then, with fresh eyes go back and try to debug my Go code.

## Day 29: Feburary 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: CRUD API Deployment

**Thoughts**: So today I wanted to deploy my Go API so off to render.com, this was a journey where I needed to rework a few things from my build inorder for render to accept my build. Namely setup my environment variables, handling the logic surrounding the variables in the code base. After several hours of reading documentation and working through errors, I was finally able to deploy the api!

## Day 28: Feburary 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Go/Gin localAPI, Go Gin GORM bit.io full CRUD API

**Thoughts**: I needed a confidence boost after yesterday's bug, so I decided to start my day off buy making a simple CRUD API not persisting in a database. After completing this I then moved on to hunt the bug from yesterday, turns out it was not much of a bug but that I had forgotten to include a database connection in `main.go`'s init func, *Facepalm* glad I slept on it because that gave me a fresh start and helped me build a even simpilar version for proof of concept. So cheers to a Full CRUD api, tomorrow I will deploy this api on render.com, time to learn about deployment.

## Day 27: Feburary 23, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Go API build part Bug

**Thoughts**: So I was able to connect to bit.io, as my database and migrate my models. However when I attempted to post data to my database I run into a `runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference` I am not sure why, I have been looking all over the internet up and down trying to understand why this is happening. So I decided to let the issue breath and start my day tomorrow with a fresh post on stackoverflow in hops that I will be able to solve this issue.

## Day 26: Feburary 22, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Go API build part 1

**Thoughts**: Today was the day I decided to begin learning how to build an API using Go, Gin, GORM, and bit.io. SO much learning on how to properly configure, errors be thy guide. I have a listening server, a home route, and successful database connection. Tomorrow I will create the models and begin work on CRUD!

## Day 25: Feburary 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Leetcode

**Thoughts**: Had a busy day today, wasn't able to code a whole lot with the kids being sick, so to make sure I was still keeping on I decided to do a leetcode problem with binary tress. This on took me a little while to fully comprehend what and how I was going to do this, I utlimately came to the conclusion that I wanted to create a win condition of true by subtracting each node from the sum argument.

## Day 24: Feburary 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: More Go

**Thoughts**: I was caught up on a peculiar bug today while working with Go, I was unable to run the executable go module after installing it through the cli. I had the correct GOPATH, GOBIN in my `go env` but for whatever reason when I ran the command `export PATH=$PATH:/location/go/bin/` then try to active the related bin application I would receive a `zsh: command not found:` or `zsh: access denied:`. I also made sure that my `.zshrc` was setup with the various GO statements, but even with everything I was finding on stackoverflow I wasn't able to solve this issue. What I ended up having to do was include the `export PATH=$PATH:/location/go/bin/` in my `.zprofile`, then I wen through the motions one more time of `go build`, check my `go env`, `go install` then I created a new terminal and ran the executable from a fresh terminal. Much to my enjoyment the program ran as intended, In lieu of this hiccup I wasn't able to make as much progress as I would have liked in building out my first api using Go. Still in good spirits as tomorrow is a new day and I am looking forward more go!

**Today's Progress**: Go (Golang) Beginnings

**Thoughts**: I decided today to embark on a journey I have been eyeing for some time, Go. I have been wanting to dive deeper into this language and learn how to build apis with Gin. So today I decided to setup my machine to learn the basics, so much to cover and only scratched the surface but more to come shortly. I did not forget about Vue, in fact I am building this backend in Go to pair with my Vue frontend.

## Day 22: Feburary 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Vue.js & Magic.link

**Thoughts**: Today I learned how to wire up a vue application with my favorite auth/payment SDK Magic.link. So many new things to play with in the comming days, I have been really impressed with how much of the vue ecosystem is maintained by vue, not third party sources. Plus their documentation is top notch A+ for helping me out when I wasn't comprehending multi-word-component-names, gotta shake that bad habit from React.

## Day 21: Feburary 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Vue.js

**Thoughts**: Today I learned so much Vue, I think my biggest take away would be how intuitive the developer expereience is. I like how you can visually see how your page is going to be built before it is even produced. Big bonus their documentation is great. I ran through the intro tutorial so far tomorrow I will dig into some more meat and start building something more pratical, I feel like a blog site will be a nice first step.

## Day 20: Feburary 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Vue.js

**Thoughts**: I have decided to build out my Blog site using Vue.js, first step on the list is to get familiar with vue and build a todo app. After that I will look to connect to a GraphQL database, and style with tailwind. This will be a couple days worth of learning and building.

## Day 19: Feburary 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio

## Day 17: Feburary 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: About Page Styling

**Thoughts**: Started styling the over all layout of about page. Along with began building out what technologies are going to look like on my portfolio, thinking I am going to make them into their own Document in my db so that way I can map over them reducing the need to hard code. Learned how to use cloudinary-next to support my photos for optimizing, sizing, and responsive options.

## Day 16: Feburary 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: About Page Base

## Day 15: Feburary 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Server Side Props

**Thoughts**: Today was a big day for reading documentation, changed over from static props to server side props for a couple pages on my portfolio. I like the results, however had a massive amount of debugging and deployment issues, come to later realize it was because I was tracking the preview deployment in vercel and the production deployemnt to troubleshoot.

## Day 14: Feburary 10, 2023

## Day 13: Feburary 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Built mobile responsive navbar

**Thoughts**: Worked off of a Kevin Powell video building a mobile responsive nav bar. After hours of reading on css properties and various logical properties, I am starting to get a better grasp on frontend CSS. I recognized that it was one of my weaknesses that I want to improve this quarter and building from scratch with vanilla helps me build a better foundation when I go to adapt and implement these tactics within React.

## Day 10: Feburary 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio Styling

**Thoughts**: Spent my day styling with CSS modules in Next.js. Met some unexpected work arounds that are presented by Next, one being the way you import and use google fonts, another being how you use font-awesome icons. I did met an error in my deployment that I will have to triage in tomorrow, but over all feel really good about what I was able to accomplish today.

## Day 7: Feburary 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Jsonwebtoken Authentication with Express.js

**Thoughts**:  So today I revisited how to implement authentication using jsonwebtokens in an Express server. Battled through a few typos and a couple trips to the docs, in the end was able to grokk the fundementals to achieve the desired end result. After taking myself thorugh this process in a practice environment I decided to implement this into my portfolio-api to protect my POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. Feeling good about how I was able to implement this so far, next step is to understand how to work through authentication with multiple realtionships.

## Day 4: January 31, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio Api

**Thoughts**: Continued working on my portfolio API, I am building this to constantly be updating my portfolio with new projects and content in a centuralized location. I refactored the codebase to reflect MVC design, spreading the route logic across two different locations, the routes and the controllers. This was a great way for me to be able to put into practice what I came to love about building API's. Looking forward to add authentication to this API so that way no one but myself will be able to interact with the data outside of GET requests.

## Day 3: January 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Problem

**Thoughts**: So today had a technical interview, so spent most of my day preping for it by reading documentation. However I did get to a leetcode problem that challenged me to implement the in-place algortihm. Having never done that before was a tall task but after words felt really good about what I learned and how I can build upon that algorithm.

## Day 2: January 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Began rebuilding Portfolio

**Thoughts**: Well the saying goes "use it or loose it." I did not loose it but I sure did struggle getting my frontend to play nice with my api. I leanred today that you cannot call getStaticProps from inside of a component rather it must be down on the page and passed to the component as props. If anyone has any experience that would contridicte my findings please feel free to share them as this was a big chunck of time. Feeling really good otherwise about how far I got on this project, excited to see how it turns out in the coming days.
