# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 4: January 31, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio Api

**Thoughts**: Continued working on my portfolio API, I am building this to constantly be updating my portfolio with new projects and content in a centuralized location. I refactored the codebase to reflect MVC design, spreading the route logic across two different locations, the routes and the controllers. This was a great way for me to be able to put into practice what I came to love about building API's. Looking forward to add authentication to this API so that way no one but myself will be able to interact with the data outside of GET requests.

## Day 3: January 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Problem

**Thoughts**: So today had a technical interview, so spent most of my day preping for it by reading documentation. However I did get to a leetcode problem that challenged me to implement the in-place algortihm. Having never done that before was a tall task but after words felt really good about what I learned and how I can build upon that algorithm.

## Day 2: January 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Began rebuilding Portfolio

**Thoughts**: Well the saying goes "use it or loose it." I did not loose it but I sure did struggle getting my frontend to play nice with my api. I leanred today that you cannot call getStaticProps from inside of a component rather it must be down on the page and passed to the component as props. If anyone has any experience that would contridicte my findings please feel free to share them as this was a big chunck of time. Feeling really good otherwise about how far I got on this project, excited to see how it turns out in the coming days.

**Thoughts**: After taking a mental health break from daily coding. I am proud to say that I am ready to once again tackle the #100daysofcode challenge. I have ben learning so much recently and really looking forward to sharing what I have been learning publicly. <br> Today I spent the vast majority freshing up on JavaScript Array methods and String methods on Codewars. Tomorrow looking to start building out the frontend of my new portfolio/blog site with Next.js.
