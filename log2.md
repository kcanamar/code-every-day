# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: January 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Codewars Challenges

**Thoughts**: After taking a mental health break from daily coding. I am proud to say that I am ready to once again tackle the #100daysofcode challenge. I have ben learning so much recently and really looking forward to sharing what I have been learning publicly. <br> Today I spent the vast majority freshing up on JavaScript Array methods and String methods on Codewars. Tomorrow looking to start building out the frontend of my new portfolio/blog site with Next.js.
